  notes:
  - The interpolation of continuous change is usually done by taking into consideration
    constraints on the "curve" joining the two data points (time1, value1) and (time2,
    value2), looking at the value as a function of time. For example, if the continuous
    change is for the motion of a vehicle, then the constraints of physics and of
    the paths appropriate for that vehicle must be taken into consideration.
