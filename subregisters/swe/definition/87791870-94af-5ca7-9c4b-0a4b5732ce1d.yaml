  definition: 'single area (or multiple areas) of land and/or water, or a single volume
    (or multiple volumes) of space

    en eller flera samhörande delar av jordytan eller en eller flera samhörande volymer
    i förhållande till jordytan'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A single area is the norm and multiple areas are the exception.
  - Spatial units are structured in a way to support the creation and management of
    basic administrative units.
  - This International Standard [ISO 19152:2012] supports either 2-dimensional (2D),
    3-dimensional (3D), or mixed (2D and 3D) representations of spatial units, which
    may be described in text (“from this tree to that river”), or based on a single
    point, or represented as a set of unstructured lines, or as a surface, or as a
    3D volume.
  - In addition to spatial units represented by a single point, text, or a set of
    unstructured lines, a spatial unit may have an area equal to zero for administrative
    reasons.
