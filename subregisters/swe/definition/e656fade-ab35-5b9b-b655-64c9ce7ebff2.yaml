  notes:
  - There is little logical difference between traveller and target except that the
    former is normally used for a moving object which is being tracked, and the latter
    is used for either an object that is not moving, or an object for which a location
    is needed only once. A traveller is the subject of a tracking service; a target
    is the subject of a locating service. Since this International Standard does not
    make a distinction between the protocols for these logically similar services,
    but does need to differentiate between the two concepts, both terms will be used
    as appropriate to the underlying semantics of the situation. Since all of these
    terms refer to entities represented by objects within the system, they can be
    combined with adjectives defined for objects. So, an active target (a target represented
    by an active object) can be used to represent a moving object, since the act of
    motion is modifying the target's internal state and is therefore initiating actions.
