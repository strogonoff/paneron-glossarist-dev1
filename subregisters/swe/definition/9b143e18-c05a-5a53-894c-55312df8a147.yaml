  definition: översättning av ett läge till koordinater

  notes:
  - Geocoding usually refers to the translation of "address" or "intersection" to
    "direct position." Many services providers also include a "reverse geocoding"
    interface to their geocoder, thus extending the definition of the service as a
    general translator of location. Because routing services use internal location
    encodings not usually available to others, a geocoder is an integral part of the
    internals of such a service.
