  notes:
  - The normal mechanism is to apply a cost to each part of a route, and to define
    the total route cost as the sum of the cost of the parts. This is necessary for
    the operation of the most common navigation algorithms. The units of cost functions
    are not limited to monetary costs and values only, but include such measures as
    time, distance, and possibly others. The only requirement is that the function
    be additive and at least non-negative. This last criteria can be softened as long
    as no zero or less cost is associated with any loop in the network, as this will
    prevent the existence of a "minimal cost" route.
