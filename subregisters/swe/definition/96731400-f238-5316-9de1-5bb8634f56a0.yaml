  examples:
  - A feature attribute named 'colour' may have an attribute value 'green' which belongs
    to the data type 'text'.
  - A feature attribute named 'length' may have an attribute value '82.4' which belongs
    to the data type 'real'.
  notes:
  - A feature attribute has a name, a data type, and a value domain associated to
    it.  A feature attribute for a feature instance also has an attribute value taken
    from the value domain.
  - In a feature catalogue, a feature attribute may include a value domain but does
    not specify attribute values for feature instances.
