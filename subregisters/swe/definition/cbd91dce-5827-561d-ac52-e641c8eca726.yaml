  definition: orienterat topologiskt objekt som anger sambandet mellan ett topologiskt
    omr√•de och en av dess orienteringar
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The orientation of the directed edges that compose the exterior boundary of a
    directed face will appear positive from the direction of this vector; the orientation
    of a directed face that bounds a topological solid will point away from the topological
    solid. Adjacent solids would use different orientations for their shared boundary,
    consistent with the same sort of association between adjacent faces and their
    shared edges. Directed faces are used in the coboundary relation to maintain the
    spatial association between face and edge.
