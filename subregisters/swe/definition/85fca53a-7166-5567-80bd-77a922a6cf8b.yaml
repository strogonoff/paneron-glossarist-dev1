  notes:
  - The most common tracking devices are cell phones, GNSS chips, RFID (Radio Frequency
    ID) tags, or printed tags which are scanable by optical sensors  such as "bar
    codes".
  - The common usage of  "vehicle" means a "form of conveyance" or, more simply "thing
    that conveys (carries) something else".  Thus, a tracked object that carries a
    tracking device to allow it to be tracked is, by definition, a conveyance or vehicle
    for that device.  Thus, a cell phone that carries a GNSS device is the vehicle
    for that device, and the traveller carrying the cell phone, allowing him to be
    tracked, is the vehicle for the phone and all of its internal electronics.
