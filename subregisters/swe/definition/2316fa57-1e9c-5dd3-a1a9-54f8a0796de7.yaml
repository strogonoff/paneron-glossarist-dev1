  notes:
  - A passive object is usually accessed through an external interface, through which
    it receives requests, processes those requests and returns data as a response
    to that request. Since objects can implement more than one type, it is possible
    for a single object to pass through active and passive states. For example, a
    tracking service can lie dormant until a tracking request activates a period where
    the internals of the object initiate tracking activities based on internal triggers
    as specified within the request. When the tracking request is deactivated, the
    object may return to a passive state.
