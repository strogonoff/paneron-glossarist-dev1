  notes:
  - The universal face is normally not part of any feature, and is used to represent
    the unbounded portion of the data set. Its interior boundary (it has no exterior
    boundary) would normally be considered the exterior boundary of the map represented
    by the data set. This International Standard does not special case the universal
    face, but application schemas may find it convenient to do so.
