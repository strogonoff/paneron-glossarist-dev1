  - The feature concept "road" may be used to specify several different feature types,
    each with a different set of properties appropriate for a particular application.  For
    a travel planning application, it might have a limited set of attributes such
    as name, route number, location and number of lanes, while for a maintenance application
    it might have an extensive set of attributes detailing the structure and composition
    of each of the layers of material for which it is composed.
