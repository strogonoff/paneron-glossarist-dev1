    ref: ISO/IEC 19501
  concept: 022184d7-568f-53ea-85d3-f94b230eb791
  definition: form of aggregation which requires that a part instance be included
    in at most one composite at a time, and that the composite object is responsible
    for the creation and destruction of the parts
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Parts with non-fixed multiplicity may be created after the composite itself,
    but once created they live and die with it (i.e., they share lifetimes). Such
    parts can also be explicitly removed before the death of the composite. Composition
    may be recursive. Synonym: composite aggregation.'
