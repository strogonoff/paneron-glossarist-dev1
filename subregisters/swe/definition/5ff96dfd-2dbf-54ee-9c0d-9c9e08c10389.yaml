  notes:
  - Directed solids are used in the coboundary relation to maintain the spatial association
    between face and topological solid. The orientation of a solid is with respect
    to a face, "+" if the upNormal is outward, "-" if inward. This is consistent with
    the concept of "up = outward" for a surface bounding a solid.
