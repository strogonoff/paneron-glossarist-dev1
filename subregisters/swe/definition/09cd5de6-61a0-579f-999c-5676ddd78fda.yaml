  notes:
  - The free variables mentioned above can usually be thought of as a local coordinate
    system. In a 3D coordinate space, a plane can be written as P(u, v) = A + u X
    + v Y, where u and v are real numbers and A is any point on the plane, and X and
    Y are two vectors tangent to the plane. Since the locations on the plane can be
    distinguished by u and v (here universally), the plane is 2D and (u, v) is a coordinate
    system for the points on the plane. On generic surfaces, this cannot, in general,
    be done universally. If we take a plane tangent to the surface, and project points
    on the surface onto this plane, we will normally get a local  isomorphism for
    small neighbourhoods of the point of tangency. This "local coordinate" system
    for the underlying surface is sufficient to establish the surface as a 2D topological
    object. Since this International Standard deals only with spatial coordinates,
    any 3D object can rely on coordinates to establish its topological dimension.
    In a 4D model (spatio-temporal), tangent spaces also play an important role in
    establishing topological dimension for objects up to 3D.
