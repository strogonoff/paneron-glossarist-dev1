  notes:
  - Payment providers can be telephone and cellular companies, banks, credit card
    corporations, ISPs, network operators, and utility companies. The payment provider
    bills the consumer, deducts a fee, and forwards the payment to the content provider.
    The payment provider is thus responsible for the balancing of accounts.
