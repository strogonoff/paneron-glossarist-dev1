  notes:
  - Boundary face strings are used to represent the boundaries of spatial units by
    means of line strings in 2D. This 2D representation is a 2D boundary in a 2D land
    administration system. In a 3D land administration system it represents a series
    of vertical boundary faces  where an unbounded volume is assumed, surrounded by
    boundary faces which intersect the Earth’s surface (such as traditionally depicted
    in the cadastral map).
