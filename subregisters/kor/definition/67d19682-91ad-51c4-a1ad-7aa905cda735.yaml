  notes:
  - The concept "measurement accuracy" is not a quantity and is not given a numerical
    quantity value. A measurement is said to be more accurate when it offers a smaller
    measurement error.
  - The term "measurement accuracy" should not be used for measurement trueness and
    the term measurement precision should not be used for "measurement accuracy",
    which, however, is related to both these concepts.
  - '"Measurement accuracy" is sometimes understood as closeness of agreement between
    measured quantity values that are being attributed to the measurand.'
