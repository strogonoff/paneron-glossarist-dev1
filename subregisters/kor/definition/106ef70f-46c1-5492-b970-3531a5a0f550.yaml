  notes:
  - Boundary faces are used when the implied vertical and unbounded faces of a boundary
    face string are not sufficient to describe 3D spatial units. Boundary faces close
    volumes in height (e.g. every apartment floor), or in depth (e.g. an underground
    parking garage), or in all other directions to form a bounded volume. The volumes
    represent legal space (in contrast with physical space).
