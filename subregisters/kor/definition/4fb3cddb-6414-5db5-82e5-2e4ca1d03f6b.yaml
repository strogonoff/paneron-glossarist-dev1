  notes:
  - A metrological traceability chain is defined through a calibration hierarchy.
  - A metrological traceability chain is used to establish metrological traceability
    of a measurement result.
  - A comparison between two measurement standards may be viewed as a calibration
    if the comparison is used to check and, if necessary, correct the quantity value
    and measurement uncertainty attributed to one of the measurement standards.
