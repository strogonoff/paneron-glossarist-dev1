  notes:
  - Measurement precision is usually expressed numerically by measures of imprecision,
    such as standard deviation, variance, or coefficient of variation under the specified
    conditions of measurement.
  - The "specified conditions" can be, for example, repeatability conditions of measurement,
    intermediate precision conditions of measurement, or reproducibility conditions
    of measurement (see ISO 5725-3).
  - Measurement precision is used to define measurement repeatability, intermediate
    measurement precision, and measurement reproducibility.
  - Sometimes "measurement precision" is erroneously used to mean measurement accuracy.
