  notes:
  - The effect is a result of Bernoulli's principle of fluid dynamics. The squat represents
    the increase in effective draught.
  - For a ship underway, the change of level of the bow and stern from the still water
    condition in response to the elevation and depression of the water level about
    the hull resulting from the bow and stern wave systems.
