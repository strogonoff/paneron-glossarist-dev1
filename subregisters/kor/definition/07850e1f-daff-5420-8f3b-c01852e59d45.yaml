  definition: 특정 토지 피복 유형에서 변화를 이끌어 내거나 유지하기 위해 사람들이 행하는 준비, 활동 또는 투입
  examples:
  - “Recreation area” is a land use term that can be applicable to different land
    cover types, e.g. sandy surfaces such as a beach; a built-up area such as a pleasure
    park; woodlands etc.
  notes:
  - The definition of land use in this way establishes a direct link between land
    cover and the actions of people in their environment. Multiple land uses can coexist
    at the same location (e.g. forestry and recreation), contrary to land cover classes
    that are mutually exclusive.
