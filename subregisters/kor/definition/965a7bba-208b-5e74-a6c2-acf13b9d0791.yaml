  notes:
  - GPLs can be granted by the owner of a resource or can be applied to a resource
    by law, usually as part of the copyright law. The most obvious GPL concept is
    fair use in the United States for copyrighted material. Other GPL rights can be
    demanded by the source of the resource or other “public good” considerations.
  - The most widespread use of GPL is in reference to the GNU GPL, which is commonly
    abbreviated simply as GPL when it is understood that the term refers to the GNU
    GPL. One of the basic tenets of the GPL is that anyone who acquires the material
    shall make it available to anyone else under the same licensing agreement. The
    GPL does not cover activities other than the copying, distributing, and modifying
    of the source code. A GPL is also referred to as a copyleft, in contrast to a
    copyright, which identifies the proprietary rights of material.
