  notes:
  - The concept of "measurement error" can be used both a) when there is a single
    reference quantity value to refer to, which occurs if a calibration is made by
    means of a measurement standard with a measured quantity value having a negligible
    measurement uncertainty or if a conventional quantity value is given, in which
    case the measurement error is known, and b) if a measurand is supposed to be represented
    by a unique true quantity value or a set of true quantity values of negligible
    range, in which case the measurement error is not known.
  - Measurement error should not be confused with production error or mistake.
