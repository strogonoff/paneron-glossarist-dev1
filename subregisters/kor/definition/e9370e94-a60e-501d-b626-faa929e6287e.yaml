  notes:
  - Typically for LIDAR, sufficient calibration has not been done to calculate absolute
    intensity, so relative intensity is usually reported.  In linear mode systems,
    this value is typically provided as an integer, resulting from a mapping of the
    return’s signal power to an integer value via a lookup table.
