  notes:
  - A LIDAR system which employs this technology typically uses processing techniques
    to develop the time-of-flight measurements from the full waveform that is reflected
    from the targets in the illuminated scene of interest. These time-of-flight measurements
    are then combined with precise platform location/attitude data along with pointing
    data to produce a three-dimensional product of the illuminated scene of interest.
