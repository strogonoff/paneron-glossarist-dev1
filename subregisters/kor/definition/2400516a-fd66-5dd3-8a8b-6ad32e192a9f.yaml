  notes:
  - Rights can be by law (copyright), by agreement, or by contract [the licence agreement].
    In the case of digital commerce, DRM ensures that licences are adhered to, and
    that rights holders are compensated as appropriate for each transaction. Agents
    of the original rights holder can also issue licences, but their ability is only
    under the agency contract to the original principal.
