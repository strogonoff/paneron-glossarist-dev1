  definition: geometric object representing a single, connected, homogeneous (isotropic)
    element of space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Geometric primitives are non-decomposed objects that present information about
    geometric configuration. They include points, curves, surfaces, and solids. Many
    geometric objects behave like primitives (supporting the same interfaces defined
    for geometric primitives) but are actually composites composed of some number
    of other primitives. General collections may be aggregates and incapable of acting
    like a primitive (such as the lines of a complex network, which is not connected
    and thus incapable of being traceable as a single line). By this definition, a
    geometric primitive is topological open, since the boundary points are not isotropic
    to the interior points. Geometry is assumed to be closed. For points, the boundary
    is empty.
