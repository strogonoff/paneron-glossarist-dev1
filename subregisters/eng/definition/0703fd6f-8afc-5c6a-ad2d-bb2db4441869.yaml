  definition: minimal length of a curve that joins the two points or geometries
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The usual distance function for two points in a coordinate space assumes an underlying
    plane and is a Euclidean distance. If the underlying Reference Surface is not
    a plane, then distance is defined by this minimum length of all curves between
    the two points. These surfaces are prime examples of non-Euclidean geometry, where
    the parallel postulate in Euclid's Elements does not hold. In mathematical terms,
    distance is the "greatest lower bound" of the length of the curves. The word minimum
    is sometimes used, but there should be no expectation that an instance of that
    minimum actually occurs, only that any larger number will have a length in the
    set that is smaller.
