  concept: 612ed3b0-c98f-5d3a-bb04-931d8b97c4d9
  definition: responsivity per unit wavelength interval at a given wavelength
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The spectral responsivity is the response of the sensor with respect to the wavelengths
    dependent radiance.
  - The definition is described mathematically in IEC 60050-845. The spectral responsivity
    is quotient of the detector output dY(λ) by the monochromatic detector input dXe(λ)
    = Xe, λ(λ) • dλ in the wavelength interval dλ as a function of the wavelength
    λ  s(λ) = dY(λ) / dXc(λ)
