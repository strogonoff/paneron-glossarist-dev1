  definition: postal address which the postal operator is requested to use to deliver
    the postal item
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In the normal case, the delivery address is the same as the postal address specified
    by the mailer.
  - The delivery address may in certain circumstances, e.g. unaddressed mail, not
    actually be represented on the postal item. In this case, the delivery address
    is determined by the postal operator in accordance with an agreement between the
    operator and the mailer.
  - The postal item might not actually be delivered to the requested delivery address.
    For example, in the case of forwarding, delivery takes place at the forwarding
    address.
