  definition: plane curve segment containing the normal at one of its terminal points
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The usual construction begins by choosing one of the end points, the normal to
    the surface at that end point, and the location of the other end point and creating
    a plane in ùîº3, which is then intersected with the datum. This curve is a normal
    section curve between these two points, containing the normal to the surface at
    the first point. On the sphere, this is the geodesic, and the two normal section
    curves are equal. On an ellipsoidal datum, the same is true for two points on
    the equator, or two points on the same meridian plane, but false in general. The
    reason is that in these cases the plane through the two points and the centre
    of the ellipsoid are planes of symmetry for the ellipsoid dividing the ellipsoid
    into symmetric "mirror" image halves. In general, the geodesic between the two
    points lies between the two normal section curves.in th
