  notes:
  - When the quality of accuracy or precision of measured values, such as coordinates,
    is to be characterized quantitatively, the quality parameter is an estimate of
    the uncertainty of the measurement results. Because accuracy is a qualitative
    concept, one should not use it quantitatively, that is associate numbers with
    it; numbers should be associated with measures of uncertainty instead.
