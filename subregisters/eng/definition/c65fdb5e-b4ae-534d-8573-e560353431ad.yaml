  definition: coordinate reference system derived from a geographic coordinate reference
    system by applying a map projection
  examples: []
  notes:
  - May be two- or three-dimensional, the dimension being equal to that of the geographic
    coordinate reference system from which it is derived.
  - In the three-dimensional case the horizontal coordinates (geodetic latitude and
    geodetic longitude coordinates) are projected to northing and easting and the
    ellipsoidal height is unchanged.
