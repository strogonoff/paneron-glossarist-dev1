  definition: individual who actually receives a postal item at delivery or who first
    accesses the postal item if it is left for collection
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The mail recipient is normally the addressee, the mailee or an authorized representative
    of one of these two. However, this might not always be the case, e.g. if the postal
    item is left for collection in a location to which third parties have access;
    if the addressee/mailee have moved without leaving forwarding instructions or
    if the addressee or mailee specification was ambiguous and was, as a result, misinterpreted
    by the postal operator
