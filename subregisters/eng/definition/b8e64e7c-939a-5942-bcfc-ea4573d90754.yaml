  definition: useful angular width of the beam of electromagnetic energy
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Beam width is usually measured in radians and as the angular width between two
    points that have 50% of the power (3 dB below) of the centre of the beam. It is
    a property of the antenna. Power emitted outside of this angle is too little to
    provide a usable return.
