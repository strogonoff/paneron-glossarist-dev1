  definition: ratio between the side lobe power and the main lobe power of the impulse
    response of point targets in the radar imaging scene
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The integrated side lobe ratio (ISLR) can be obtained by integrating the power
    of the impulse response over suitable regions. The ISLRis expressed as  `ISLR
    = 10log_(10) {(P_(text(total))-P_(text(main)))/(P_(text(main)))}` where  `P_(text(total))`
    is the total power, `P_(text(main))` is the main lobe power.
  - The main lobe width can be taken as α times the impulse response width (IRW),
    centred around the peak, where α is a predefined constant, usually between 2 and
    2,5.
