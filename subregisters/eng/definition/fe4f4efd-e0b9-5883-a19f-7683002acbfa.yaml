  definition: never increasing or never decreasing
  examples: []
  notes:
  - An increasing sequence never gets smaller. A strictly increasing sequence always
    gets larger. A decreasing sequence never gets larger. A strictly decreasing sequence
    always gets smaller. `[x(i) "is increasing"] hArr [i < j => x(i) <= x(j)]` `[x(i)
    "is strickly increasing"] hArr [i < j => x(i) < x(j)]` `[x(i) text( is decreasing)]
    hArr [i < j => x(i) >= x(j)]` `[x(i) text( is strickly decreasing)] hArr [i <
    j => x(i) > x(j)]` `[x(i) text( is decreasing)] vv [x(i) text( is increasing)]
    hArr [x(i) text( is monotonic)]`
