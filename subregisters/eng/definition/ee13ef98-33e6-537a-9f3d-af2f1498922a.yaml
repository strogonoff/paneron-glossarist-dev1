  definition: position within a network on a link defined by some strictly monotonic
    measure associated with that link
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Link positions are often associated with a target feature that is not part of
    the network. The most common link measures used for this are the distance from
    start node or address. The most common use of a link position is to geolocate
    an "address."
