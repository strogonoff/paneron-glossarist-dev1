  definition: number of independent decisions in a coordinate system required to locate
    a position

  notes:
  - This definition is logically equivalent to the topological dimension of spatial
    projection of the CRS. It describes the space as a target for geometry. Grammatically,
    the term can be a noun but used to describe space, as "the spatial dimension of
    CRS84 is 2".
