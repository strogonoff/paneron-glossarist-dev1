  definition: abstract structure consisting of a set of 0-dimensional objects called
    junctions, and a set of 1-dimensional objects called links that connect the junctions,
    each link being associated with a start (origin, source) junction and end (destination,
    sink) junction
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The network is essentially the universe of discourse for the navigation problem.  Networks
    are a variety of 1-dimensional topological complex. In this light, junction and
    topological node are synonyms, as are link and directed edge.
