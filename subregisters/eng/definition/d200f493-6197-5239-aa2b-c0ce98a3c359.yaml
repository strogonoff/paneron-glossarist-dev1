  definition: property of a topological space implying that only the entire space
    or the empty set are the only subsets which are both open and closed
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The formal definition of connected is that any pair of locally open sets whose
    union is the entire space must have a non-empty intersection.   \(\text{a topological
    space T is connected if and only if } [\forall X,Y \subset T \backepsilon X \cup
    Y = T] \implies [X \cap Y \ne \emptyset]\) This formal definition is difficult
    to use. The term path connected, defined below is equivalent for the purposed
    of this document. The use or "finite precision" coordinates makes sets which are
    connected but not path connected impossible to represent. In all cases "connected"
    is used, but "path connected" is easier to test and to visualize.
