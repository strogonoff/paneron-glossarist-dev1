  definition: party designated in a postal address as having responsibility for ensuring
    that postal items reach their addressee
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Unlike the addressee, the mailee is always specified explicitly in a postal address,
    i.e. if a postal address does not contain a mailee, then there is no mailee.
  - Notwithstanding Note 1 to entry, the mailee may be designated explicitly by use
    of a role descriptor or designated implicitly with no role descriptor.
  - As is the case for addressee, a mailee specified in a postal address might be
    ambiguous.
