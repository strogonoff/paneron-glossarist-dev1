  definition: directed topological object that represents an association between a
    node and one of its orientations
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Directed nodes are used in the coboundary relation to maintain the spatial association
    between edge and node. The orientation of a node is with respect to an edge, "+"
    for end node, "-" for start node. This is consistent with the vector notion of
    "result = end - start".
