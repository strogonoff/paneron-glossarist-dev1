  definition: convex hull of n+1 points in general position in a space of dimension
    at least n, or a topologically isomorphic image of such a geometry
  examples: []
  notes:
  - An n-simplex is n-dimensional, and is topological isomorphic to an n-disc. A 0-simplex
    is a point. A 1-simplex is a curve (usually a line) with two 0-simplexes (points)
    on its boundary; a 2-simplex is a triangular surface with three 1-simplices on
    its boundary. In general, an n-simplex boundary will have n (n−1)-simplexes. An
    n-simplex and an n-disc are topologically isomorphic. The boundary of an n-simplex
    is isomorphic to an (n−1)-sphere. In all cases, the number prefix represents the
    topological dimension of the object.
