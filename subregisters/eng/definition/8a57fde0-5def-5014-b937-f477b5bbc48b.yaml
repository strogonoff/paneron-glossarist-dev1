  definition: reference frame describing the relation of gravity-related heights or
    depths to the Earth
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In most cases, the vertical reference frame will be related to mean sea level.
    Vertical datums include sounding datums (used for hydrographic purposes), in which
    case the heights may be negative heights or depths.
  - Ellipsoidal heights are related to a three-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinate
    system referenced to a geodetic reference frame.
