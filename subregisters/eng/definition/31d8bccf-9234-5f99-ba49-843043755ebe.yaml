  definition: distance measure on a ùîºn coordinate space using a root-mean sum of the
    differences between the individual coordinate offsets
  examples: []
  notes:
  - '`P = (p_i), Q = (q_i), "distance"(P,Q) = sqrt( sum_{i=1}^n (p_i - q_i)^2)`. The
    proofs of the Pythagorean metrics all depend on the local "flatness" of the space.
    Cartesian coordinate space which have Pythagorean metrics are called Euclidean
    spaces (`bbb"E"^n`). In the realm of coordinate reference systems, only "Engineering
    Coordinate Systems" are Euclidean. Any CRS using a curved Datum are by definition
    non-Euclidean, and cannot "truthfully" use Pythagorean metrics except for approximation.
    These approximations are valid for topological statements, but not for real world
    measures without adjustments.'
