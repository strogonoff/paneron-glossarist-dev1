  definition: measure of the pairs of values of an attribute type that assigns a numeric
    value that is positive, symmetric and satisfies the triangular inequality
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A measure "d" is positive if d(x, y) > 0 for every x, y where x/=y and d(x,x)
    = 0. A measure "d" is symmetric if d(x, y) = d(y, x)  for every x, y. A measure
    "d" satisfies the triangular inequality if d(x, y) <= d(x, a) + d(a, y) for every
    a, x and y. All numeric or vector valued attributes have such a metric, the most
    common being the Euclidean metric based on the square root of the sum of the squares
    of the differences in each dimension. Other non-Euclidean metrics take "curvature
    of space" into account (such as along the surface of the spheroid).
