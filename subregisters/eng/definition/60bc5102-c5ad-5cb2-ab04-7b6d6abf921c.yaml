  definition: classification scheme structured so that the classes are abstract conceptualizations
    of the types actually occurring
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Taken from FAO LCCS version 2 (see Reference [2] in ISO 19144-1)
  - The approach is based upon definition of classes before any data collection actually
    takes place
  - See Annex B [of ISO 19144-1] for an examination of this and a posteriori classification
