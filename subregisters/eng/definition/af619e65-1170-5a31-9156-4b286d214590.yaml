  definition: ratio between the peak power of the largest side lobe and the peak power
    of the main lobe of the impulse response of point targets in the SAR image
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The peak side lobe ratio is usually expressed in decibels (dB) and computed as
    follows `PSLR = 10log_(10) {(P_(text(sidepeak)))/(P_(text(mainpeak)))}` where
    `P_(text(mainpeak))` is the peak power of the main lobe; `P_(text(sidepeak))`
    is the peak power of the largest side lobe.
