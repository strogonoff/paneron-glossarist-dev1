  definition: common URI prefix or stem used in identifiers for a set of related resources
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The RDF namespace is concatenated with the localName to create the complete URI
    identifier for an RDF resource. Every RDF resource is identified by a URI. In
    contrast, an XML namespace URI scopes a local XML component name, but there is
    no rule for combining these into a single identifier string.
