  concept: deca1d35-45a3-524d-9dd4-e7089b4124c3
  definition: largest element smaller than or equal to all elements of a set contained
    in an ordered domain <<math>>
  examples: []
  notes:
  - '`[AA a in A => min(A) <= a] => [AA b in [(b in [AA a in A => b <=a] => [min(A)
    >= b]]` Any number is a lower bound of `O/` considered as a set of numbers, because
    any given number is less than any number in `O/` (an admitted vacuous statement
    since there is no number in `O/`, but true nonetheless). This means that the `min(O/)`
    must be greater than any number; this `+oo`.'
