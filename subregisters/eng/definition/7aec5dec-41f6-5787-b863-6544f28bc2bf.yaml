  definition: resolution in the cross-range direction
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This is usually measured in terms of the impulse response of the SAR sensor and
    processing system. It is a function of the size of the synthetic aperture, or
    alternatively the dwell time (i.e. a larger aperture results in a longer dwell
    time results in better resolution).
