  definition: smallest convex set containing a given geometric object
  examples: []
  notes:
  - '"Smallest" is the set theoretic smallest, not an indication of a measurement.
    The definition can be rewritten as "the intersection of all convex sets that contain
    the geometric object". Another definition in a Euclidean space `bbb"E"^n` is the
    union of all lines with both end points in the given geometric object. `C = A."convexHull"
    <=> [C."convex" = "TRUE"] ^^ [A sub C] ^^ [[B."convex" = "true", A sub B] => [A
    sube C sube B]]`'
