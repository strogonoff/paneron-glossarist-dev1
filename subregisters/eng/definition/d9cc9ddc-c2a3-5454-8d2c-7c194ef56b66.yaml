  concept: 3ddac6e2-0fb2-5693-bbfd-2554819c0538
  definition: data type that describes a point or geometry potentially occupied by
    an object or person
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A direct position is a semantic subtype of position. Direct positions as described
    can only define a point and therefore not all positions can be represented by
    a direct position. That is consistent with the "is type of" relation.  An 19107
    geometry is also a position, just not a direct position.
