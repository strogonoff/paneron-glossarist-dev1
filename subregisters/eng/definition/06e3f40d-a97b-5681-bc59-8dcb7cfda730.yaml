  concept: 2b6b5f24-f4dc-5a7b-b9c5-9c7b4503d28e
  definition: administrative entity, subject to registration (by law), or recordation
    [by informal right , or customary right, or another social tenure relationship],
    consisting of zero or more spatial units against which (one or more) unique and
    homogeneous rights [e.g. ownership right or land  use right], responsibilities
    or restrictions are associated to the whole entity, as included in a land administration
    system
  examples:
  - A condominium unit comprising two spatial units (e.g. an apartment and a garage),
    a farm lot comprising one spatial unit (e.g. parcel of land), a servitude comprising
    one spatial unit (e.g. the road representing the right-of-way), a land consolidation
    area, or a right-of-use unit with several right holders and restricted objects.
  notes:
  - '''Unique'' means that a right, restriction, or responsibility is held by one
    or more parties (e.g. owners or users) for the whole basic administrative unit.
    ''Homogeneous'' means that a right, restriction or responsibility (e.g. ownership,
    use, social tenure, lease, or easement) affects the whole basic administrative
    unit. For a restriction, zero parties are a possibility.'
  - A basic administrative unit may play the role of party, e.g. when the right holder
    is a basic administrative unit (and not a person or organization).
  - A baunit should get a unique identifier when registered, or recorded.
  - A baunit can consist of zero spatial units, when a registry exists, and not a
    cadastre.
  - Restrictions and responsibilities can be associated with their own baunits, each
    with their own type of spatial unit.
