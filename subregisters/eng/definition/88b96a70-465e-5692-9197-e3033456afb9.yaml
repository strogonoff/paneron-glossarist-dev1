  concept: 917fd6f2-faff-5d23-bc64-fedc67a78ce2
  definition: set of topological primitives of higher topological dimension associated
    with a particular topological object, such that this topological object is in
    each of their boundaries
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If a node is on the boundary of an edge, that edge is on the coboundary of that
    node. Any orientation parameter associated to one of these relations would also
    be associated to the other. So that if the node is the end node of the edge (defined
    as the end of the positive directed edge), then the positive orientation of the
    node (defined as the positive directed node) would have the edge on its coboundary,
    see ISO 19107 Figure 35.
