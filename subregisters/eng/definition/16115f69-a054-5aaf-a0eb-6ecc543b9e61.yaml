  definition: coordinate reference system that has a dynamic reference frame
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Coordinates of points on or near the crust of the Earth that are referenced to
    a dynamic coordinate reference system may change with time, usually due to crustal
    deformations such as tectonic motion and glacial isostatic adjustment.
  - Metadata for a dataset referenced to a dynamic coordinate reference system should
    include coordinate epoch information.
