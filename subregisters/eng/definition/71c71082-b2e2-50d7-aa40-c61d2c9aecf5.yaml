  definition: arrangements, activities and inputs people undertake in a certain land
    cover type to maintain it or produce change
  examples:
  - “Recreation area” is a land use term that can be applicable to different land
    cover types, e.g. sandy surfaces such as a beach; a built-up area such as a pleasure
    park; woodlands etc.
  notes:
  - The definition of land use in this way establishes a direct link between land
    cover and the actions of people in their environment. Multiple land uses can coexist
    at the same location (e.g. forestry and recreation), contrary to land cover classes
    that are mutually exclusive.
