    of a specified coordinate conversion to the coordinates within a previously established
    coordinate reference system
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The previously established coordinate reference system is referred to as the base
    coordinate reference system.
  - A derived coordinate reference system inherits its datum or reference frame from
    its base coordinate reference system.
  - The coordinate conversion between the base and derived coordinate reference system
    is implemented using the parameters and formula(s) specified in the definition
    of the coordinate conversion.
