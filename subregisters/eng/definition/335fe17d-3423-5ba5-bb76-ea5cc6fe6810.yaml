  definition: matrix characterizing the scattering process at the target of interest
    for polarimetric SAR
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Scattering matrix is defined via `((E_H^s),(E_V^s)) = e^(jkR)/R ([S_(HH),S_(HV)],
    [S_(VH), S_(VV)])((E_H^j), (E_V^j))` where `([S_(HH),S_(HV)], [S_(VH), S_(VV)])`
    is the scattering matrix; `((E_H^j), (E_V^j))` is the electronic field vector
    of the wave incident on the scatterer; `((E_H^s), (E_V^s))` is the electronic
    field vector of the scattered wave; `k` is the wavenumber of the illuminating
    wave; `R` is the distance between the target and the radar antenna.
