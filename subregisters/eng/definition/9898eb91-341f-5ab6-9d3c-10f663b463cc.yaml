    ref: ISO 19133:2005
  concept: 2e3b9bcc-c1be-5583-b8f5-abe6224ef049
  definition: to represent (an abstraction) by the creation of a concrete instance
    or to create the ability to create an instance
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A class or data element definition instantiates a type if it creates the ability
    to create objects or data elements respectively, that can represent the concepts
    (instance data and /or operations) defined by that type. A class is instantiated
    by an object if the class defines that object's structure and function. A data
    schema is instantiated by a data element if the data schema defines that element's
    structure.
