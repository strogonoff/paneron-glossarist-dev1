  definition: first derivative of a curve parameterized by arc length
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If `c(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))` is a curve in a 3D Cartesian space (`bbb"E"^3`),
    and `s` is arc length along `c`, then the tangent is `vec tau(s) = dot c(s) =
    (dot x(s), dot y(s), dot z(s))`, i.e. the derivative of the coordinate values
    of `c` with respect to `s`. The curvature vector is `kappa(s) = ddot c(s) = (ddot
    x(s), ddot y(s), ddot z(s))`.
