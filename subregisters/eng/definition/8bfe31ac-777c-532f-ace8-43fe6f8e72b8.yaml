  definition: directed topological object that represents an association between an
    edge and one of its orientations
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A directed edge that is in agreement with the orientation of the edge has a +
    orientation, otherwise, it has the opposite (-) orientation. Directed edge is
    used in topology to distinguish the right side (-) from the left side (+) of the
    same edge and the start node (-) and end node (+) of the same edge and in computational
    topology to represent these concepts.
