  definition: device consisting of a spinning rotor mounted in a gimbal so that its
    axis of rotation maintains a fixed orientation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The rotor spins on a fixed axis while the structure around it rotates or tilts.
    In airplanes, the pitch and orientation of the airplane is measured against the
    steady spin of the gyroscope. In space, where the four compass points are meaningless,
    the gyroscope's axis of rotation is used as a reference point for navigation.
    An inertial navigation system includes three gimbal-mounted gyroscopes, used to
    measure roll, pitch, and yaw.
