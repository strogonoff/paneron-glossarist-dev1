  definition: realization of a terrestrial reference system (TRS), by specifying its
    origin, orientation, scale, and its time evolution
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The realization is achieved through a set of physical points with precisely determined
    coordinates in a specific coordinate system, which may include the rate of coordinate
    change.
  - The realization is called static when no rates of coordinate change are defined,
    and kinematic when rates of coordinate change are defined without considering
    the underlying forces causing the motion. The realization may be called dynamic
    when these external forces are considered. "Dynamic" is also used colloquially
    to describe both the dynamic and kinematic cases without distinction.
