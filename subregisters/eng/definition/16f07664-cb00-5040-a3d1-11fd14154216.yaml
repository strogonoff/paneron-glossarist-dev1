    ref: ISO 19132:2007
  concept: d2440f02-265a-5827-8a14-dadd6a643163
  definition: object which is capable of independent actions, and therefore capable
    of initiating interactions between itself and other objects without immediate
    prior external stimulation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - cf. passive object. An active object can represent a user, or an active service
    that depends on internal (and therefore not visible) triggers to start actions.
    Active and passive states can exist for the same object, and such a service can
    transition between these two states depending on invocation of an activation or
    deactivation operation protocol.
