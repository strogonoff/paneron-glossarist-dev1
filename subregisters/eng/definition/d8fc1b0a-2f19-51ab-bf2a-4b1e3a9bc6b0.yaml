  definition: largest number n such that each point in a set of points can be associated
    with a subset that has that point in its interior and is topologically isomorphic
    to ùîºn, Euclidean n-space

  notes:
  - Curves, because they are continuous images of a portion of the real line, have
    geometric dimension 1. Surfaces cannot always be mapped to `RR^2` in their entirety,
    but around each point position, a small neighborhood can be found that resembles
    (under continuous functions) the interior of the unit circle in `RR^2`, and are
    therefore 2-dimensional. In this document, most surfaces (instances of Surface)
    are mapped to portions of `RR^2` by their defining interpolation mechanisms.
