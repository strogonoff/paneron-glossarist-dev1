  definition: 1-dimensional geometric primitive, representing the continuous image
    of a line
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The boundary of a curve is the set of points at either end of the curve. If the
    curve is a cycle, the two ends are identical, and the curve (if topologically
    closed) is considered to not have a boundary. The first point is called the start
    point, and the last is the end point. Connectivity of the curve is guaranteed
    by the "continuous image of a line" clause. A topological theorem states that
    a continuous image of a connected set is connected.
