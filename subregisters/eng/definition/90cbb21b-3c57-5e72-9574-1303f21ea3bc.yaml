  definition: common root classifier of a category which is a superclass of any other
    classifier in the category
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The class Any in some programming languages is the abstract root of all classes.
    Thus, it is the de facto union of all classes. In this document, Geometry is the
    (named and explicit) abstract root for all geometry objects. In the package Geometry
    and any of its subpackages (including those in its Requirements Classes), any
    interface will be a subtype of Geometry either directly or transitively.
