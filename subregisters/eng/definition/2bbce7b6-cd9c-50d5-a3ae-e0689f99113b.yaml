  definition: complex all of whose elements are also in a larger complex
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Since the definitions of geometric complex and topological complex require only
    that they be closed under boundary operations, the set of any primitives of a
    particular dimension and below is always a subcomplex of the original, larger
    complex. Thus, any full planar topological complex contains an edge-node graph
    as a subcomplex.
