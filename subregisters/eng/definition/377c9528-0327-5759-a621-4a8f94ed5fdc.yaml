  notes:
  - 'DRM covers a much broader spectrum of capabilities and underlying technologies
    supporting description, identification, trading, protecting, monitoring, and tracking
    of all forms of rights usages for both tangible and intangible (electronic) assets,
    including the management of rights-holders relationships. See, for example, Reference
    [5][of ISO 19153:2014 - Iannella R. Digital Rights Management (DRM) Architectures.

    at: http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june01/iannella/06iannella.html]. “Digital” refers
    to the material over which the rights exist. “Rights” applies to the Intellectual
    Property rights linked to the material. “Management” covers both the defining
    of policy and enforcing that policy in such a way that rights are respected. The
    ultimate goal of a distributed DRM system is for content authors to be able to
    project policies governing their content into remote environments with confidence
    that those policies will be respected by the remote nodes. For the purposes of
    this International Standard, DRM is taken to mean technology that enables the
    secure distribution (and where appropriate, sale) of digital media content on
    the Internet.'
