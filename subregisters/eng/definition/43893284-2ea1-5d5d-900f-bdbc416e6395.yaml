  concept: 74d2c1af-dbc3-5f92-b10a-cff40720b72d
  definition: information that maps a data object into more meaningful concepts
  examples:
  - Representation information for a bit sequence which is a FITS file might consist
    of the FITS standard which defines the format plus a dictionary which defines
    the meaning in the file of keywords which are not part of the standard.
  - JPEG software which is used to render a JPEG file; rendering the JPEG file as
    bits is not very meaningful to humans but the software, which embodies an understanding
    of the JPEG standard, maps the bits into pixels which can then be rendered as
    an image for human viewing.
