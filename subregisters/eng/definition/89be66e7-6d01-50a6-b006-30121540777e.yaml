  concept: d33068b7-5c42-5e50-b7f2-203cd7bb26af
  definition: face that is used in the 3-dimensional representation of a boundary
    of a spatial unit
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Boundary faces are used when the implied vertical and unbounded faces of a boundary
    face string are not sufficient to describe 3D spatial units. Boundary faces close
    volumes in height (e.g. every apartment floor), or in depth (e.g. an underground
    parking garage), or in all other directions to form a bounded volume. The volumes
    represent legal space (in contrast with physical space).
