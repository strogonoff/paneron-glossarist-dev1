  definition: geometric reference surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space formed by
    an ellipse that is rotated about a main axis
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For the Earth the ellipsoid is bi-axial with rotation about the polar axis. This
    results in an oblate ellipsoid with the midpoint of the foci located at the nominal
    centre of the Earth.
