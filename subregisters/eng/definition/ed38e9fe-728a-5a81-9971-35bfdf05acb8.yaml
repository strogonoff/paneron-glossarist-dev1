  concept: ba2a132c-4350-57cd-8494-9a197dbf2bbc
  definition: storage mechanism for multidimensional array in linear memory, organized
    such that each row is stored in consecutive locations and such that the complete
    rows are the stored one after the other and continuing on is a similar fashion
    of each additional index
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'If the indexes are `(i, j)` with the number of rows `r` and columns `c`, then
    the mapping between the multidimensional locations to the linear storage locations
    is given by: \[[i,j \in \mathbb{Z} \backepsilon 1 \leq i \leq r; 1 \leq j \leq
    c] \implies [(i,j) \rightarrow (i-1)c + j]\] \[[i,j,k \in \mathbb{Z} \backepsilon
    1 \leq i \leq r; 1 \leq j \leq c; 1 \leq k \leq f] \implies [(i,j,k) \rightarrow
    ((i-1)c + j -1)f + k]\]'
  - 'The matrix `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]` in row major form is stored as `[1, 2,
    3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. For higher dimensions, the same pattern is applied recursively:'
