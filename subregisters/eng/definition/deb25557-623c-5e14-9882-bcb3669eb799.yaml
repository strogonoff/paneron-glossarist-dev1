  definition: relationship between two domains such that there is a structure-preserving
    function from one to the other
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A homomorphism is distinct from a isomorphism in that no inverse function is required.
    In an isomorphism, there are two homomorphisms that are functional inverses of
    one another. Continuous functions are topological homomorphisms because they preserve
    "topological characteristics". The mapping of topological complexes to their geometric
    realizations preserves the concept of boundary and is therefore a homomorphism.
