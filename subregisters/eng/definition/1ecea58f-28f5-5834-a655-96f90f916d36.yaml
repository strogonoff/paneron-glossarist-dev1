      Seaway
  concept: 2261b177-48cf-535c-bb28-14d11a4ae2c9
  definition: effect that causes a vessel moving through water to create an area of
    lowered pressure under its bottom that increases the effective draught (i.e. lowers
    the vessel in the water)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The effect is a result of Bernoulli's principle of fluid dynamics. The squat represents
    the increase in effective draught.
  - For a ship underway, the change of level of the bow and stern from the still water
    condition in response to the elevation and depression of the water level about
    the hull resulting from the bow and stern wave systems.
