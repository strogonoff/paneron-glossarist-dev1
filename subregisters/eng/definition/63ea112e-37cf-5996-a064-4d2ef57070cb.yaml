  definition: conversion of one type of value to a value of a different type with
    similar content
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Point and DirectPosition are informationally identical (related to each other
    in a one to one fashion) in this context. Given a DirectPosition, a Point can
    be constructed. Given a Point, a DirectPosition can be derived from of its coordinates.
    If coercion is supported, a Point may be used where a DirectPosition is requested,
    and vice versa. Most programming languages use coercion, but others use "cast"
    operators (a type of constructor) requiring the programmer to initiate the coercion.
    "Strong substantiality" is related in that a subtype instance can always be coerced
    to any of its supertypes.
