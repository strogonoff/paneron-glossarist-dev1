  definition: datum describing the relation of gravity-related heights or depths to
    the Earth
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In most cases, the vertical datum will be related to mean sea level. Ellipsoidal
    heights are treated as related to a three-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinate system
    referenced to a geodetic datum. Vertical datums include sounding datums (used
    for hydrographic purposes), in which case the heights may be negative heights
    or depths.
