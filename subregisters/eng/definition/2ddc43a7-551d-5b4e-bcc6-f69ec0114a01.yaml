  definition: set of points an equal distance from a given point (on the datum)
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The geodesic circles centred on a pole (either one) are the lines of constant
    latitude. Circles in a tangent space centred on the origin (corresponding to the
    point of tangency) map to geodesic circles by the exponential map on the geometric
    reference surface centred on the point of tangency.
