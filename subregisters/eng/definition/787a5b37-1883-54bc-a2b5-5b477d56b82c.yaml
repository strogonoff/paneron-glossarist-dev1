  concept: d554ffc1-aa85-5cb8-ba3c-2f751677e735
  definition: containing all points on a "line" joining two interior points
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The definition of convex requires a definition of line. For coordinate systems,
    this is the usual linear interpolated arc, but in context, the "line" on a geometric
    reference surface will be a "geodesic arc". The default in this document is the
    linear interpolate.
