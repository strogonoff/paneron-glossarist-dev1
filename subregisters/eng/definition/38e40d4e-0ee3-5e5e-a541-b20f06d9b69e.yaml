  concept: 12b2581a-73d0-5032-93c5-219eddbd9028
  definition: sequence of agency where the agent in each relationship is the principal
    of the next in the chain
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A chain of agency, with the proper agreements at each step creates a transitive
    agency between the agent of the first link and the principal of the last. This
    chain can be spoken of in either direction, either as “principal -> agent = principal
    -> agent” (normal or granting order) or “agent -> principal = agent -> principal”
    (reverse, acceptance, verification or tracing order).
