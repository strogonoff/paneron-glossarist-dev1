  notes:
  - '"A Euclidean space with a spatial dimension of 3, ùîº3, usually uses axis names
    ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', Its first spatial dimension is ''x'', its second is ''y''
    and its third is ''z''." In the context of the space, the adjective use describes
    the space but the singular noun can use a name for an axis separately.'
