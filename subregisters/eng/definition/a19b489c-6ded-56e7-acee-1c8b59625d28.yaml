  concept: d2cc3fbb-c36d-5cc8-90ee-a38797b469a8
  definition: group of multiple realizations of the same terrestrial or vertical reference
    system that, for approximate spatial referencing purposes, are not significantly
    different
  examples:
  - WGS 84 as an undifferentiated group of realizations including WGS 84 (TRANSIT),
    WGS 84 (G730), WGS 84 (G873), WGS 84 (G1150), WGS 84 (G1674) and WGS 84 (G1762).
    At the surface of the Earth these have changed on average by 0.7 m between the
    TRANSIT and G730 realizations, a further 0.2 m between G730 and G873, 0.06 m between
    G873 and G1150, 0.2 m between G1150 and G1674 and 0.02 m between G1674 and G1762).
  notes:
  - Datasets referenced to the different realizations within a datum ensemble may
    be merged without coordinate transformation.
  - '''Approximate'' is for users to define and typically is in the order of under
    1 decimetre but may be up to 2 metres.'
