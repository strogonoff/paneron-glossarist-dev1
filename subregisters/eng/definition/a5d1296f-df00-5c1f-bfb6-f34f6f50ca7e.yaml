  definition: SAR mode in which the antenna beam is steered to illuminate a swath
    of ground at various angles relative to flight path throughout the collection
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Steering the antenna also allows dwell time to be increased and provides the ability
    to collect strips at angles non-parallel to the flight direction and with better
    resolution than Stripmap mode.
