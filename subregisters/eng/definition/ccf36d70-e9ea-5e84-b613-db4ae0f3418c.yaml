  definition: coordinate operation that changes coordinates in a source coordinate
    reference system to coordinates in a target coordinate reference system in which
    the source and target coordinate reference systems are based on different datums
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A coordinate transformation uses parameters which are derived empirically. Any
    error in those coordinates will be embedded in the coordinate transformation and
    when the coordinate transformation is applied the embedded errors are transmitted
    to output coordinates.
  - A coordinate transformation is colloquially sometimes referred to as a 'datum
    transformation'. This is erroneous. A coordinate transformation changes coordinate
    values. It does not change the definition of the datum. In this document coordinates
    are referenced to a coordinate reference system. A coordinate transformation operates
    between two coordinate reference systems, not between two datums.
