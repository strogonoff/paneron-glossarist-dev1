  definition: geometric complex whose geometric primitives are in a 1-to-1 correspondence
    to the topological primitives of a topological complex, such that the boundary
    relations in the two complexes agree
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In such a realization the topological primitives are considered to represent the
    interiors of the corresponding geometric primitives. Composites are closed.
