  definition: curve on a surface with a zero-length tangential curvature vector
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A geodesic's curvature vector is perpendicular the surface thus has the minimum
    curvature of any curve restricted to the surface. This is often defined as a minimal
    distance curve between two points, but this does not always suffice, since some
    points (especially on ellipsoids and spheres) are often joined by more than one
    geodesic. For example, on an ellipsoid the points with (φ, λ) = (0, 0) and (0,
    180) are joined by four separate geodesic [2 polar (the shorter) and 2 equatorial].
    The exponential map is only guaranteed to be one-to-one for a small area (depending
    on where the centre is and how the surface is curved).
