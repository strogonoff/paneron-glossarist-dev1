  definition: bounded spatial object with an empty boundary
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Cycles are used to describe boundary components. A cycle usually has no boundary
    because it closes on itself, but it is bounded (i.e., it does not have infinite
    extent). A circle or a sphere, for example, has no boundary (i.e., its boundary
    is empty), but is bounded.
