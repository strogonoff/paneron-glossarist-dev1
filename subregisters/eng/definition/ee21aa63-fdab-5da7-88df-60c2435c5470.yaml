  definition: positively weighted directed graph appropriately configured to execute
    a shortest path search
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The term comes from the most commonly known algorithm for finding a shortest path
    in a positively weighted graph, from E. Dijkstra's paper [7]. Although this algorithm
    is not the only one in use, the requirements for the graph are common to most.
    The most common relaxation of the requirement is the "positive weights," which
    are not needed in the Bellman-Ford algorithm [4], [8].
