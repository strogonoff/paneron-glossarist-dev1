  definition: data sufficient to identify an object over time, independent of its
    state
  examples: []
  notes:
  - An identity is usually a persistent and constant key member attribute value of
    the object. Since it is temporally constant and unique, it will be the same in
    any state associated to the object regardless of its timestamp. A moving object's
    identity is independent of both time and location.
