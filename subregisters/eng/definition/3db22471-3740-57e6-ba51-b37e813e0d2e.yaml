  definition: system consisting of 1) a photon source (frequently, but not necessarily,
    a laser), 2) a photon detection system, 3) a timing circuit, and 4) optics for
    both the source and the receiver that uses emitted laser light to measure ranges
    to and/or properties of solid objects, gases, or particulates in the atmosphere
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Time of flight (TOF) LIDARs use short laser pulses and precisely record the time
    each laser pulse was emitted and the time each reflected return(s) is received
    in order to calculate the distance(s) to the scatterer(s) encountered by the emitted
    pulse. For topographic LIDAR, these time-of-flight measurements are then combined
    with precise platform location/attitude data along with pointing data to produce
    a three-dimensional product of the illuminated scene of interest.
