  definition: average radar cross section per unit area
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'If the radar return from the illuminated area is contributed by a number of independent
    scattering elements, it is described by the backscattering coefficient instead
    of radar cross section used for the point target. It is calculated as `sigma^0
    = sigma/A` Where `sigma` is the total radar cross section of an area `A`. `sigma^0`
    is a dimesionless parameter and is usually expressed in decibels (dB) as follows:
    `sigma_(dB)^0 = 10 log_(10) sigma^0`'
  - “Backscattering coefficient” is sometimes called “normalized radar cross section”.
