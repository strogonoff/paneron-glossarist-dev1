  concept: 0fce6992-ca94-5d98-8e2f-815ea2c01d6f
  definition: structured information that allows the unambiguous determination of
    an object for purposes of identification and location
  examples:
  - 'Address where the object is a business: 611 Fifth Avenue, New York NY 10022.'
  - 'Address where the object is a building: Lombardy House, 809 Lombardy Street,
    The Hills, 0039, South Africa.'
  - 'Address where the object is a land parcel for a building: San 4–5, Munjae-ro,
    Songpa-gu, Seoul, 13144, South Korea.'
  - 'Address where the object is a building group, such as a school or large apartment
    area: 228-dong 404-ho, 26 Kyunghee-daero, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130–701, South
    Korea.'
  notes:
  - The object is identifiable in the real world, i.e. electronic and virtual addresses
    are excluded.
  - “Identification” refers to the fact that the structured information in the address
    unambiguously determines the object, i.e. it helps the human to identify the object.
    In other words, “identification” here does not refer to unique identifiers in
    a database or dataset.
  - There can be many addresses for an object, but at any moment (or lifecycle stage),
    an address unambiguously determines a single object (see ISO 19160-1:2015, Annex
    D for examples).
  - Two addresses from two different address classes (i.e. they have different sets
    of components) for the same addressable object are two different addresses (refer
    to ISO 19160-1:2015, Annex E for more examples).
  - Two addresses for the same addressable object and from the same address class,
    but in two different languages are two different addresses (refer to ISO 19160-1:2015,
    Annex E for more examples).
  - In addition to the addressable object, there may be a multitude of people, organizations,
    addressees or other objects associated with an address. These are external to
    the address model (refer to ISO 19160-1:2015, Annex C and Annex F for examples).
