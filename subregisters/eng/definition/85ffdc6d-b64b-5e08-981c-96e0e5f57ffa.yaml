  concept: 70dcc484-dec4-539d-b2e4-84bf8faff4fd
  definition: digital elevation model (DEM) that incorporates the elevation of important
    topographic features on the land.
  examples: []
  notes:
  - DTMs are comprised of mass points and breaklines that are irregularly spaced to
    better characterize the true shape of the bare-earth terrain. The net result of
    DTMs is that the distinctive terrain features are more clearly defined and precisely
    located, and contours generated from DTMs more closely approximate the real shape
    of the terrain.
