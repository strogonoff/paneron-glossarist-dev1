    ref: ISO 19107:2003
  concept: 9a63c2c9-cf35-5484-8bb7-9c2ec5ae27da
  definition: property of a geometric object that its interior is isotropic (all points
    have isomorphic neighbourhoods), and hence everywhere locally isomorphic to an
    open subset of a Euclidean coordinate space of the appropriate dimension
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This implies that no interior direct position is involved in a self-intersection
    of any kind.
