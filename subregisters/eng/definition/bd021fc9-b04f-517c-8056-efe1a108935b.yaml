  notes:
  - An abstract test case is a formal basis for deriving executable test cases One
    or more test purposes are encapsulated in the abstract test case. An abstract
    test case is independent of both the implementation and the values. It should
    be complete in the sense that it is sufficient to enable a test verdict to be
    assigned unambiguously to each potentially observable test outcome (i.e. sequence
    of test events).
