  definition: number of separate decisions needed to describe a position in a coordinate
    system
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The coordinate dimension represents the number of choices made, and constraints
    can restrict choices. A barycentric coordinate which has (n+1)-offsets, but the
    underlying space is dimension n. Homogeneous coordinates (wx, wy, wz, w) are actually
    3 dimensional because the choice of "w" does not affect the position, i.e. (wx,
    wy, wz, w) = (x y, z, 1) â†’ (x, y, z) which is not affected by w. The dimension
    will be at most the count of the numbers in the coordinate, but it can be less
    if the coordinates are constrained in some manner.asie
