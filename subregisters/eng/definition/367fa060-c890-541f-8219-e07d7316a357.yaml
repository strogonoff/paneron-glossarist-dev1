  concept: 9c1235e6-becc-54de-811b-ac455125a7e7
  definition: height that is dependent on the Earthâ€™s gravity field
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This refers to, amongst others, orthometric height and Normal height, which are
    both approximations of the distance of a point above the mean sea level, but also
    may include Normal-orthometric heights, dynamic heights or geopotential numbers.
  - The distance from the reference surface may follow a curved line, not necessarily
    straight, as it is influenced by the direction of gravity.
