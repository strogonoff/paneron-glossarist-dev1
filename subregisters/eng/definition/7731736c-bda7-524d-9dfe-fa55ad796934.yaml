    ref: OMG/UML UML Semantics
  concept: e450d51c-a8e1-5d91-9f1e-ffb5fc5f985a
  definition: entity with a well defined boundary and identity that encapsulates state
    and behaviour
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This term was first used in this way in the general theory of object oriented
    programming, and later adopted for use in this same sense in UML. An object is
    an instance of a class. Attributes and relationships represent state. Operations,
    methods, and state machines represent behavior.
