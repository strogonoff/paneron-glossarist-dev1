  definition: ordered sequence of timestamps associated to a sequence of representations
    of the same object
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Temporal sequences are not assumed to be evenly spaced in time, nor equidistance
    in space. For discrete change, the default logic is to sample at temporal points
    of change if possible, so that the timestamp is the first temporal instance where
    the attributes listed have taken on that combination of values. For sake of space
    savings, some samples in a sequence only list those values that have changed since
    the immediately preceding temporal sample. For this reason, a sample should only
    be considered in the context of its containing sequence. For rigid motions (such
    as vehicle tracking), only centroid (a point value) and orientation (direction
    of travel) are needed for a temporal sequence describing location and spatial
    extent. A motion in combination with an object deformation would require more
    information.
