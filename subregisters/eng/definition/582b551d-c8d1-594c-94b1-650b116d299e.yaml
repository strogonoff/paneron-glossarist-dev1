  notes:
  - Measurements acquired in the field are affected by many instrumental and environmental
    factors, including meteorological conditions, computational methods and constraints,
    imperfect instrument construction, incomplete instrument adjustment or calibration,
    and, in the case of optical measuring systems, the personal bias of the observer.  Solutions
    for positions may be affected by the geometric relationships of the observed data
    and/or mathematical model employed in the processing software.
