  definition: containing a metric or topologically open neighborhood of each of its
    points
  examples: []
  notes:
  - In a metric space, a set `X` us open if each point `x` in the set is contained
    in some small ball which is a subset of \(X:\) \([X \text{ is open}] \Leftrightarrow
    [x \in X] \implies [\exists \varepsilon > 0 \backepsilon \text{distance} (x,y)
    < \varepsilon] \implies [y \in X]\). A topology is a set of subsets of a space
    which are considered open.
