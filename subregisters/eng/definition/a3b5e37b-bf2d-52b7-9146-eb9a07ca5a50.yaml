  definition: linear feature that describes a change in the smoothness or continuity
    of a surface
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A soft breakline ensures that known z-values along a linear feature are maintained
    (for example, elevations along a pipeline, road centreline or drainage ditch),
    and ensures that linear features and polygon edges are maintained in a Triangulated
    Irregular Network (TIN) surface model, by enforcing the breaklines as TIN edges.
    They are generally synonymous with 3-D breaklines because they are depicted with
    series of x/y/z coordinates. Somewhat rounded ridges or the trough of a drain
    may be collected using soft breaklines.
  - A hard breakline defines interruptions in surface smoothness, for example, to
    define streams, shorelines, dams, ridges, building footprints, and other locations
    with abrupt surface changes.
