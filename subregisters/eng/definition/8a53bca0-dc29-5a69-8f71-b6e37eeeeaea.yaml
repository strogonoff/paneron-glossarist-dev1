  definition: photon counting mode for LIDAR systems, where the detector is biased
    and becomes sensitive to individual photons
  examples: []
  notes:
  - These detectors exist in the form of arrays and are bonded with electronic circuitry.  The
    electronic circuitry produces a measurement corresponding to the time at which
    the current was generated; resulting in a direct time-of-flight measurement.  A
    LIDAR that employs this detector technology typically illuminates a large scene
    with a single pulse.  The direct time-of-flight measurements are then combined
    with platform location/attitude data along with pointing information to produce
    a three-dimensional product of the illuminated scene of interest.  Additional
    processing is applied which removes existing noise present in the data to produce
    a visually exploitable data set.
