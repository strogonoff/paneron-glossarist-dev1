  definition: coordinate reference system for the positions in a grid that uses a
    defined coordinate system congruent with the coordinate system described by the
    GridEnvelope and axisLabels of gml:GridType
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A grid CRS uses a defined coordinate system with the same grid point positions
    and origin as the GridEnvelope, with the same axisLabels, but need not define
    any limits on the grid size. This coordinate system is sometimes called the internal
    grid coordinate system.
