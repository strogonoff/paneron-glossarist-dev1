  definition: set of disjoint geometric primitives where the boundary of each geometric
    primitive can be represented as the union of other geometric primitives of smaller
    dimension within the same set
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The geometric primitives in the set are disjoint in the sense that no direct position
    is interior to more than one geometric primitive. The set is closed under boundary
    operations, meaning that for each element in the geometric complex, there is a
    collection (also a geometric complex) of geometric primitives that represents
    the boundary of that element. Recall that the boundary of a point (the only 0D
    primitive object type in geometry) is empty. Thus, if the largest dimension geometric
    primitive is a solid (3D), the composition of the boundary operator in this definition
    terminates after at most three steps. It is also the case that the boundary of
    any object is a cycle.
