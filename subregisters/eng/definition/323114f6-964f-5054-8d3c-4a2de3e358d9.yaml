  definition: angle-preserving
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Some projections are conformal. For example, a Mercator preserves the angle between
    curves, so that if two curves in a Mercator projected plane cross at a 90°, then
    the preimage curves on the ellipsoid also cross at 90°, such as lines of constant
    latitude and lines of constant longitude.
