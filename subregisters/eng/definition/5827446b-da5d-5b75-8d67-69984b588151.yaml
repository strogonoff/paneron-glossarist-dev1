    ref: ISO/IEC 19501
  concept: 621183d7-70d7-5ec1-88f8-63fdc2e6b6ec
  definition: new type of modeling element that extends the semantics of the metamodel
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Stereotypes must be based on certain existing types or classes in the metamodel.
    Stereotypes may extend the semantics, but not the structure of pre-existing types
    and classes. Certain stereotypes are predefined in the UML, others may be user
    defined. Stereotypes are one of three extensibility mechanisms in UML. The others
    are constraint and tagged value.
