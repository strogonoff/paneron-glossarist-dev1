  notes:
  - A dataset may be a smaller grouping of data which, though limited by some constraint
    such as spatial extent or feature type, is located physically within a larger
    dataset. Theoretically, a dataset may be as small as a single feature or feature
    attribute contained within a larger dataset. A hardcopy map or chart may be considered
    a dataset.
