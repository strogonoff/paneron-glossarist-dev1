  definition: coordinate operation in which both coordinate reference systems are
    based on the same datum
  examples:
  - Conversion from an ellipsoidal coordinate reference system based on the WGS84
    datum to a Cartesian coordinate reference system also based on the WGS84 datum,
    or change of units such as from radians to degrees or feet to metres.
