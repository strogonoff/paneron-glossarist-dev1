  definition: projection of the curvature vector of the curve perpendicular to the
    tangent plane to the surface at the point
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The normal curvature vector of a curve is dependent only on the curve and the
    surface (which is a constraint on the curve). The normal curvature vector of a
    curve restricted to a surface is parallel to the normal vector of the surface.
    If the normal curvature vector is equal to the curvature vector of the curve everywhere,
    then the curve is a geodesic.
