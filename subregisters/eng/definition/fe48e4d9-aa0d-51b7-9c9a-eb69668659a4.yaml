  concept: 4b98af84-f640-55f9-b3b6-890340792ea4
  definition: representation, using a local origin and local ordinate vectors, of
    a geometric object at a given reference time
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A rigid geometric object may undergo translation or rotation, but remains congruent
    with its base representation.
  - The local origin and ordinate vectors establish an engineering coordinate reference
    system (ISO 19111), also called a local frame or a local Euclidean coordinate
    system.
