  definition: horizontal angle at a point relative to a specified direction
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The direction is usually specified to be north. In some communities the term bearing
    refers specifically to grid north and directions relative to true north are then
    termed ‘azimuth’; in other communities a bearing refers specifically to true north.
    In this International Standard bearing is used for any specified reference direction.
    The angle may be reckoned positive clockwise or positive counter-clockwise depending
    upon the application.
