  definition: spatial object without a boundary
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Cycles are used to describe boundary components (see shell, ring). A cycle has
    no boundary because it closes on itself, but it is bounded (i.e., it does not
    have infinite extent).  A circle or a sphere, for example, has no boundary, but
    is bounded.
