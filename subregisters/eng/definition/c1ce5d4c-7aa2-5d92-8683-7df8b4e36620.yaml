  definition: closeness of the relative positions of features in a dataset to their
    respective relative positions accepted as or being true
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Relative accuracy may also be referred to as point-to-point accuracy. The general
    measure of relative accuracy is an evaluation of the random errors (systematic
    errors and blunders removed) in determining the positional orientation (for example,
    distance and azimuth) of one point or feature with respect to another. In lidar,
    this also may specifically mean the accuracy between adjacent swaths within a
    lift, adjacent lifts within a project, or between adjacent projects.
