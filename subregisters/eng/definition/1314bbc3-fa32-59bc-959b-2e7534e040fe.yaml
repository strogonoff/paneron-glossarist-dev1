  definition: homogeneous (all points have isomorphic neighborhoods) and with a simple
    boundary
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The interior is everywhere locally isomorphic to an open disc in a Euclidean coordinate
    space of the appropriate dimension `D^n = {P | norm P < 1.0}`. The boundary is
    a dimension one smaller. This essentially means that the object does not intersect
    nor touch itself. Generally used for a curve that does not cross not touch itself
    with the possible exception of boundary points. Simple closed curves are isomorphic
    to a circle.
