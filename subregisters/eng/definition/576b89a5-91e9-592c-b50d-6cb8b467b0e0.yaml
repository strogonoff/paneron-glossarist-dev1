  concept: 1ab20219-b4c8-5404-a782-372c5fb8ecd6
  definition: closeness of coordinate value to the true or accepted value in a specified
    reference system
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The phrase "absolute accuracy" is sometimes used for this concept to distinguish
    it from relative positional accuracy.  Where the true coordinate value may not
    be perfectly known, accuracy is normally tested by comparison to available values
    that can best be accepted as true.
