  definition: SAR sensor enhanced by transmitting and receiving in different combinations
    of polarization
  examples: []
  notes:
  - By combining multiple polarization modes, it is possible to characterize the target
    more clearly. Quad-Pol SAR system both transmits and receives orthogonal (e.g.
    horizontal and vertical) polarizations, which creates four polarizations of a
    single imaging scene. The calibration of Quad-Pol SAR is addressed in this document.
