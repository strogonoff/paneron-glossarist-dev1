  definition: second derivative of a curve parameterized by arc length, at a point
  examples: []
  notes:
  - If `c(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))` is a curve in a 3D Cartesian space (`bbb"E"^3`),
    and `s` is the arc length along `c(s)`, then the unit tangent vector is `dot c(s)
    = (dot x(s), dot y(s), dot z(s))`, i.e. the derivative of the coordinate values
    of `c` with respect to `s`. The curvature vector is `ddot c(s) = (ddot x(s), ddot
    y(s), ddot z(s))`. The curvature vector can be approximated by the inverse of
    the radius of a circle through any 3 nearby points on the curve (pointed from
    the curve to towards the centre of the circle)
