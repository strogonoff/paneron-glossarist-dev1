  concept: ffa72814-ca10-56d5-a7ef-8a97295a387c
  definition: smallest element larger than or equal to all elements of a set contained
    in an ordered domain <<math>>
  examples: []
  notes:
  - \[[\forall a \in A \implies max(A) \geq a] \implies [\forall b \ni [(b \ni [\forall
    a \in A \implies b \geq a] \implies [max(a) \leq b]]\] Any number is an upper
    bound of `O/` (empty set) as a set of numbers, because any given number is greater
    than any number in `O/` (an admitted vacuous statement since there is no number
    in `O/`, but true nonetheless). This means that the `max(O/)` must be smaller
    than any number; thus `-oo`.
