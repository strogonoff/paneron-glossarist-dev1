  definition: collection of related links and turns used in a route in combination
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Maneuvers are used to cluster turns into convenient and legal combinations. They
    may be as simple as a single turn, a combination of quick turns ("jogs" in the
    American mid-west consisting of a turn followed immediately by a turn in the opposite
    direction) or very complex combinations consisting of entry, exit, and connecting
    roadways  ("magic roundabouts" in the UK).
