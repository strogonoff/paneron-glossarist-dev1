    ref: ISO 19107:2003
  concept: 3decb52f-923e-5c15-9d6b-1dc485f4bdea
  definition: largest number n such that each direct position in a geometric set can
    be associated with a subset that has the direct position in its interior and is
    similar (isomorphic) to Rn, Euclidean n-space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Curves, because they are continuous images of a portion of the real line, have
    geometric dimension 1. Surfaces cannot be mapped to R2 in their entirety, but
    around each point position, a small neighbourhood can be found that resembles
    (under continuous functions) the interior of the unit circle in R2, and are therefore
    2-dimensional. In this International Standard, most surface patches (instances
    of GM_SurfacePatch) are mapped to portions of R2 by their defining interpolation
    mechanisms.
