  concept: 517d4d02-cfb9-588a-acda-d7f58e6c4333
  definition: reduction of the number of data elements, bandwidth, cost, and time
    for the generation, transmission, and storage of data without loss of information
    by eliminating unnecessary redundancy, removing irrelevancy, or using special
    coding
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Whereas data compaction reduces the amount of data used to represent a given amount
    of information, data compression does not.
  - Data compaction can be done through aggregation of like values in adjacent grid
    cells, tiling schemes or other means of eliminating information that is not relevant.
