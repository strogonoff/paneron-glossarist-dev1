  definition: relationship between two domains (such as two complexes) such that there
    are 1-to-1, structure-preserving functions from each domain onto the other, and
    the composition of the two functions, in either order, is the corresponding identity
    function

  notes:
  - 'A geometric complex is isomorphic to a topological complex if their elements
    are in a 1-to-1, dimension- and boundary-preserving correspondence to one another.
    \[[A,B \textit{ isomorphic}] \Leftrightarrow [\exists f : A \rightarrow B, g :
    B \rightarrow A \backepsilon f \circ g = Id_A, g \circ f = Id_B]\]'
