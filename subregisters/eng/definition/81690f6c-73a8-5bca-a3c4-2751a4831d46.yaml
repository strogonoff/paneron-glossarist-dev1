  definition: transfer of digital information, while intending to preserve it, within
    the OAIS
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Digital migration is distinguished from transfers in general by three attributes:  —
    a focus on the preservation of the full information content that needs preservation;
    —  a perspective that the new archival implementation of the information is a
    replacement for the old; —  an understanding that full control and responsibility
    over all aspects of the transfer resides with the OAIS.'
