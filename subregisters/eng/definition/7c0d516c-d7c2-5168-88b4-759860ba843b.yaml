    joining any two direct positions in the geometric set is also contained in the
    geometric set
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Convex sets are "simply connected", meaning that they have no interior holes,
    and can normally be considered topologically isomorphic to a Euclidean ball of
    the appropriate dimension. So the surface of a sphere can be considered to be
    geodesically convex.
