  definition: property of a geometric object implying that any two points on the object
    can be placed on a curve that remains totally within the object
  examples: []
  notes:
  - There are more general geometries that are connected but not path connected, but
    they are not representable as collections of  "digital" geometries defined in
    this document. No geometric objects constructible by the methods in this document
    on a standard digital computer can be connected but not path connected. See the
    notes at the term "connected"
