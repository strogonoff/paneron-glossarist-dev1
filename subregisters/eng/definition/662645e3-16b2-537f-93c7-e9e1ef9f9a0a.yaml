    ref: ISO 19133:2005
  concept: a8c2cd78-2b4f-5c8a-92fb-ceb41fe7ca37
  definition: set of criteria used at a turn in lieu of a route instruction; default
    instruction used at a node
  examples: []
  notes:
  - This rule represents what is "most natural" to do at a node (intersection), given
    the entry link used. The most common version is "as straight as possible", or
    to exit a turn on the most obvious extension of the entry street, which is usually,
    but not always, the same named street that was the entry. Every node in a route
    is either associated with an instruction or can be navigated by the main-road
    rule.
