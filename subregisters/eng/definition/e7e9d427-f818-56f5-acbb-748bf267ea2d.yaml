  concept: aa64c659-9929-5e42-a840-a76a0856de31
  definition: largest element smaller than or equal to all elements of a set contained
    in an ordered domain <<math>>
  examples: []
  notes:
  - \[[\forall a \in A \implies min(A) \leq a] \implies [\forall b \ni [(b \ni [\forall
    a \in A \implies b \leq a] \implies [min(A) \geq b]]\] Any number is a lower bound
    of `O/` considered as a set of numbers, because any given number is less than
    any number in `O/` (an admitted vacuous statement since there is no number in
    `O/`, but true nonetheless). This means that the `min(O/)` must be greater than
    any number; this `+oo`.
