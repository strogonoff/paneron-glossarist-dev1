  definition: linkage of two or more software systems through information transfer
    or messaging
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Compare with integration. While the conceptual schema of the information transferred
    shall be agreed upon to some level, coupling applications can be and are usually
    flexible in the data representation of that information as long as the semantics
    content is correct and mappable to some canonical representation of the conceptual
    schema. The most common mapping technology used for XML messages is XSLT, and
    the transformation stylesheet can be supplied either by the service broker or
    by the service provider. It is considered a best practice for a service provider
    to supply his functionality through several logically equivalent messaging APIs,
    each represented by a different URI linked to an XSLT transformation bridge, and
    implemented by the same internal code.
  - Loose coupling and tight coupling are not at present well-defined terms in the
    literature. Generally, "tight" coupling means that there is some sort of incurred
    dependency between requester and responder in the use of the interface, while
    "loose" means no such dependency. The nature of that dependency is not consistently
    defined between authors.  In that light, "tight" coupling or "tight" integration
    are both bad practices, and have been viewed as such since the inception of the
    terms. Some literature refers to integration as "tight coupling", but that is
    a less accurate description.
