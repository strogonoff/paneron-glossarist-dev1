  concept: ebc56d4b-b7d4-5d65-be1e-d3ee774c981f
  definition: service providing a basic function to other services or applications
    in a functional manner
  examples: []
  notes:
  - cf. interoperate. Basic services lack any persistent, user-specific state information
    between invocations and are not meant for direct access by users. Because they
    act in a functional manner, they are readily replaceable at runtime by other services
    using the same interfaces.
