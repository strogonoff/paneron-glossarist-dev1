  concept: c3a5825e-469a-5841-b0af-c277d8c49052
  definition: condition of a link or turn that allows or restricts all traffic's traversal,
    as opposed to a more detailed navigation constraint
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Traversability is usually a function of physical, cultural, or legal conditions.
    If traversable is false, then the object cannot be navigated. This effectively
    removes a link from the usable network. In the case of a node, it effectively
    removes the node and all associated links from the useable network. In the case
    of a turn, it simply removes it from any viable route.  Non-traversable entities
    are not included in maneuvers or routes.
