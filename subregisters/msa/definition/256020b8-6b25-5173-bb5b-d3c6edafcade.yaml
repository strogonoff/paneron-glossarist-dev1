  notes:
  - Time of flight (TOF) LIDARs use short laser pulses and precisely record the time
    each laser pulse was emitted and the time each reflected return(s) is received
    in order to calculate the distance(s) to the scatterer(s) encountered by the emitted
    pulse. For topographic LIDAR, these time-of-flight measurements are then combined
    with precise platform location/attitude data along with pointing data to produce
    a three-dimensional product of the illuminated scene of interest.
