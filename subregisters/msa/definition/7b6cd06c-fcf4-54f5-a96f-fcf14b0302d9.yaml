  notes:
  - Homomorphisms are distinct from isomorphisms in that no inverse function is required.
    In an isomorphism, there are essentially two homomorphisms that are functional
    inverses of one another. Continuous functions are topological homomorphisms because
    they preserve "topological characteristics." The mapping of topological complexes
    to their geometric realizations preserves the concept of boundary and is therefore
    a homomorphism.
