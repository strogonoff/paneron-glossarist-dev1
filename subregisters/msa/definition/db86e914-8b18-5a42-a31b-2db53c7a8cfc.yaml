  - In some legal traditions, “party” refers to person in a legal dispute, while “principal”
    can be the entity initiating a contract, such as an agency.
  notes:
  - These two terms [principal and party] are used as near synonyms from ORDL and
    ISO 21000. There will be no distinction between these two terms made here, but
    there can be distinctions in legal documents depending on local laws.
