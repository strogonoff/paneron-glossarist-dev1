  notes:
  - Trust allows the owner [or his agent] to act with a higher potential risk because
    the expected risk has been lowered. This is slightly different from the plain
    language of trust. Normally, trust requires something, but if the principal at
    risk decides that no risk exists, then trust exists (in the sense here) because
    risk has been reduced, whatever the reason.
