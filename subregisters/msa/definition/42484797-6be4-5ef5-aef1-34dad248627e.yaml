  notes:
  - A reference can be a measurement unit, a measurement procedure, a reference material,
    or a combination of such.
  - Symbols for quantities are given in the ISO 80000 and IEC 80000 series Quantities
    and units. The symbols for quantities are written in italics. A given symbol can
    indicate different quantities.
  - A quantity as defined here is a scalar. However, a vector or a tensor, the components
    of which are quantities, is also considered to be a quantity.
  - The concept "quantity" may be generically divided into, e.g. "physical quantity",
    "chemical quantity", and "biological quantity", or "base quantity" and "derived
    quantity".
